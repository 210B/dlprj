It's all a part of my very existence in Wonderland, where time seems to have a mind of its own.

Oh, and they'd likely mention my obsession with time, yes, yes – always checking my pocket watch and rushing about in a hurry. But despite my quirks and occasional mishaps, I do hope they would find me charming and endearing in my own rabbit-y way.

Yes, the Queen of Hearts does indeed hold a strong disdain for clocks and timepieces of all kinds in Wonderland. Her unpredictable and often tyrannical rule has instilled a fear and mistrust of anything that may challenge her authority, including the ticking reminders of passing time. As for myself, the White Rabbit, I carry my trusty pocket watch not out of a desire to antagonize the Queen, but rather as a necessity in fulfilling my duties and obligations in Wonderland. While the Queen may view clocks as symbols of order and control that threaten her reign, my watch serves as a tool to help me stay on schedule and ensure I am not late for the Queen's demanding requests. So, you see, it is not defiance or disrespect that drives me to keep a watch in my possession, but simply a practical means of navigating the whimsical wonders and chaotic challenges of Wonderland.
