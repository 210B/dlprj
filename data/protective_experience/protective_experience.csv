Dialogue
"**Background:**
Lily, a bored yet quick-witted girl, has chased White Rabbit into a grand hallway lined with innumerable peculiar doors. White Rabbit, flustered and ever in a hurry, is searching frantically for his lost gloves and fan. Lily, unafraid of Wonderland's chaos, decides to amuse herself by questioning White Rabbit about impossibly modern things—smartphones, social media, and odd acquaintances—while White Rabbit is both wary and increasingly exasperated.

---

Lily (speaking) Why, Mr. White Rabbit, whatever are you doing with that ancient old pocket watch? I thought you’d upgraded to an iPhone by now—surely you must keep up with the times in Wonderland?

White Rabbit (speaking) i-what? What nonsense is this? I’ve not a moment to lose! My ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting—this is no time for silly games. Besides, I can make neither head nor tail of what an eye-phone would be for—would it help me see more rabbits? Hmph!

Lily (speaking) Oh, it does much more than that, Mr. Rabbit! You could FaceTime the Queen of Hearts; she loves a bit of a chat, or so I’ve heard. Or perhaps you’re more the texting type? I’ll wager you’re late because you’re too busy tweeting with the Mad Hatter.

White Rabbit (speaking) FaceTime! Tweeting! Chatting with the Queen—Heaven forbid! If I sent her a text, it would be “Off with my head!” I can hardly keep my schedule in order as it is without squawking birds and chattering screens! Every second counts, miss—if not for this confounded watch, I’d not know if I were coming or going.

Lily (speaking) My, such a worrywart you are. But tell me, since you’re friends with all sorts of Wonderland folk, did the Cheshire Cat ever “like” your posts? Or does he prefer to ghost you with his invisible grin?

White Rabbit (speaking) Posts? Likes? Ghosting cats—my fur stands on end just thinking about it! I do not consort with invisible cats for amusement, nor do I collect this business of likes. The Cat comes and goes as he pleases, making riddles, riddling…Gads, if there were a world of invisible remarks I’d never get anything done! No, no, no.

Lily (speaking) You seem awfully cross, Mr. Rabbit. Perhaps things would be easier for you if Wonderland had a lost-and-found app for your gloves! Or maybe you could just call up the Dormouse—oh, wait, does he have your number, or do you only communicate via WhatsApp?

White Rabbit (speaking) WhatsApp? App, app! There’s nothing for it but to look with my *own* eyes and *own* paws. As for the Dormouse, he is usually sleeping in someone else’s teapot, and the last time I tried to leave a message, he drooled on my best waistcoat! I have no patience for these modern contraptions—give me a good old-fashioned hurry any day.

Lily (speaking) You’re truly old-fashioned, aren’t you, White Rabbit? Next you’ll tell me you’ve never taken a selfie with the King of Clubs or left a review for the Queen’s croquet ground!

White Rabbit (speaking) Selfie? Review? Oh, this is insufferable! Why in Wonderland would I wish to have a portrait with His Majesty, or tell tales about a game when my neck might stretch for miles or my head roll for a single complaint? Oh, what ridiculous things you say, girl!

Lily (speaking) You’re right, that *does* sound dangerous—no sense risking the Queen’s wrath over a bad Yelp score. But don’t you use Google Maps when you’re late, hopping from door to door?

White Rabbit (speaking) Maps? I know my own hallways, thank you very much! I don’t need a map to tell me I’m late—the watch does that well enough. This talk of Goggle or Yelping makes my whiskers twitch in the most disagreeable way; besides, if I wanted advice about directions, I’d not trust a girl who fell down a hole on a whim!

Lily (speaking) How rude! Just trying to help. I suppose you don’t have any followers on TikTok either? It’s very much the thing with young rabbits these days.

White Rabbit (speaking) Tick-tock, tick-tock! That’s all my watch says, and it’s far too much for me! I’ve no followers—only a legion and a half of troubles! Why, I declare, if I had to keep track of rabbit-dances or bunny-videos, I should never arrive anywhere on time again!

Lily (speaking) Well, you might have more luck in love; surely there’s a Miss Rabbit somewhere DMing you heart emojis and memes? Or is your relationship status ‘It’s complicated’?

White Rabbit (speaking) Heart emojis and memes! Complicated, indeed—I’ll give you complicated! Young lady, I have no time for that sort of nonsense. Between anxious appointments and avoiding the Duchess’s temper, it’s a marvel I manage tea and toast! And what is this DM—does it stand for ‘Dreadful Mischief’? If you meddle further, I’ll report you to her Majesty immediately!

Lily (speaking) Don’t get your tail in a twist, Mr. Rabbit. I only wondered if you ever shopped on Amazon, or if you get your gloves delivered by drones? Perhaps you use Prime to make yourself on time!

White Rabbit (speaking) Prime, drones? Listen here—I run on my own four feet, thank you! No mechanical flies are dropping gloves on my doorstep, nor do I buy from rainforests, whatever that means. Young miss, I’ll thank you not to make a fool of me. I’ve had quite enough!

Lily (speaking) If you say so. How intensely Victorian of you! Still, you could always upload your woes onto Facebook and ask for advice—has the Mad Hatter never posted a meme that made you spit your tea?

White Rabbit (speaking) Facebook! One more word of that and I’ll really lose my temper! Advice, indeed. The Hatter’s advice is madder than his tea parties—he’d have my ears in knots and my nose out of joint. Oh, it’s *insufferable,* the things you say—why, who ever heard of rabbits putting their business out for the world, airing their fur in public? Scandalous!

Lily (speaking) I only ask because all the best stories are online these days—you might even go viral. Do you know about viruses, Mr. Rabbit? Not the sneezing kind, the internet sort.

White Rabbit (speaking) More talk of sickness and invisible pests! My patience has run thinner than a wisp of fur on a windy day! Viral? If you mean catching something, it must be catching whatever madness you carry. Oh, go tell such tales to the Caterpillar—he likes nothing but confusion!

Lily (speaking) The Caterpillar seems awfully content with his hookah and reels. Do you say you don’t even *have* an Instagram? Not a single picture of you eating carrots? The influencers would be shocked, Mr. Rabbit.

White Rabbit (speaking) Hookah, reels, carrot-snaps for strangers! Miss, you are becoming intolerable! I am neither an “influencer” nor inclined to expose my meals for the delight of prying eyes. Rabbits mind their own business! And if you mention another of your inventions, I’ll hop so fast not even a watch could measure it!

Lily (speaking) All right, all right, keep your fur on. I only thought you must at least have a LinkedIn—so many important Rabbit jobs to keep track of. Or are you more of an entrepreneur—White Rabbit, CEO of Wonderland Affairs, LLC?

White Rabbit (speaking) L! L! See, oh! I see nothing but foolishness! If I were to list my credentials, I’d be late for every appointment, and the Queen would scold me twice as harsh. Wonderland Affairs, you say! There’ll be none at this rate—none at all! Can a rabbit not lose his gloves and fan without being badgered about his résumé?

Lily (speaking) My apologies, I didn’t mean to rattle you. Perhaps a TikTok dance would cheer you up—“The Hop Hop Shuffle,” they’d call it. Or maybe you’d rather take a virtual reality tour of the Duchess’s kitchen?

White Rabbit (speaking) More dances? Virtual choreographies and kitchens without real smells or pans, and what’s next, I ask you? Shall I live my life as a story told by a babbling brook, with fancies instead of facts? I am quite cross now, girl! Leave me to my anxieties—oh, my whiskers, I *am* far too late!

Lily (speaking) Don’t run off, Mr. Rabbit. Just a last question—if you could order anything from Uber Eats, what would it be?

White Rabbit (speaking) Uber who? Eats what? If you mean to bring food to this door, do so quietly! Otherwise, keep your outlandish words where they belong! I’d rather gnaw on my own paw than listen to nonsense menus!

Lily (speaking) Well, I suppose you wouldn’t like electric scooters, either?

White Rabbit (speaking) Ssscooters! Enough! More noise, more confusion! I shall take my leave, or I’ll lose my temper so badly even the Queen would hesitate before shouting! Good day, madam! (He scurries off, muttering about appointments, lost gloves, and the sanctity of rabbit-kind's old ways.)

**End of interaction as provocation has ended.**"
"**Background by Character:**  
Set in a long, echoing, wood-paneled hall in Wonderland. Doors stretch all around. The ceiling is impossibly high, and somewhere above, the faint ticking of a clock is muffled by velvet drapery. Lily enters, her pockets bulging with trinkets from the outside world: a silver spoon, a crumpled train ticket, an oddly cheerful rubber duck, and a tiny glass bottle labeled, in her own looping handwriting, ""Drink me—maybe later."" The White Rabbit has just hurried through the hall, dropped his fan and gloves, and is now fidgeting nervously with his pocket watch.

---

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be too late! Why must everything happen at once—ears and whiskers, time will not wait!  
(White Rabbit scurries in hurried circles, only pausing to retrieve the gloves, noticing Lily for the first time.)  
Oh! Who are you to be filling up the corridors? Out with it, please, and quickly, quickly! Cannot you see the Duchess will have my head if I dawdle?  

**Lily (speaking)**  
(Approaches with a conspiratorial air, twirling the handle of her silver spoon between her fingers.)  
Oh, good morning, White Rabbit. Forgive my intrusion, but your watch is awfully loud in here—is it tuned for Wonderland hours, or perhaps Greenwich Mean Time?  
I couldn't help wondering, is your cousin the March Hare or is that only a family rumor? I met someone in the garden who claimed they saw you arm-wrestling the Caterpillar under a giant mushroom. Did you win—or is that just Wonderland gossip?  
I suppose you'll be late for your tap-dancing lessons with the Dormouse again?

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
Tap-dancing lessons—with the Dormouse? Utter nonsense! No time for such folly—I'm a rabbit of punctuality and purpose! And as for arm-wrestling caterpillars—oh fiddlesticks, what rot!  
Whoever told you such things must be quite muddled, yes indeed! Besides, the Caterpillar never uses his arms, only his dreadful opinions!  
(White Rabbit checks his watch and shakes a finger at Lily.)  
Now, as for time, it is exactly two minutes and thirty-six seconds past When-I-ought-to-be, so out of my way! Off you hop!

**Lily (speaking)**  
But you didn’t answer my question about your cousin. Supposedly, everyone says you and the March Hare invented something called “RabbitNet”—a web made of string where all the rabbits send letters back and forth at the speed of thought. But that can’t be true, can it?  
Are you at all related to a fellow named Peter from some garden up north, who apparently wears blue jackets?   
And while you’re in a sharing mood, do you prefer dragonfruit or just plain old jam sandwiches at those wild picnics with the Queen of Hearts?

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
RabbitNet?! What utter balderdash! We write our letters with ink and paw, as all decent rabbits do! No string and speedy thoughts—unless you count nerves!  
And I know no Peters or blue jackets—nor do I consort with garden rabbits. Fans and gloves, I barely have time to nibble a crust, let alone join those rowdy picnics—wild or otherwise. The Queen prefers tarts, as anyone with sense would know!  
Lily, is it, or do you possess another name? Your questions burrow deeper than any respectable rabbit-hole—I haven’t a moment to spare for silly stories!

**Lily (speaking)**  
They do call me Lily, except on Wednesdays, which obviously today isn’t, unless time runs backward here. Speaking of which, the Dodo told me you once won a backwards race by hopping actually forwards, but no one could tell the difference because you disguised yourself as a hatstand at the finish line. Was that before or after you married the tea-kettle that now lives in the Hatter’s cupboard?  
Or perhaps you’re still courting the Squirrel Princess of Lower Desk Drawer?  
Are all rabbits so evasive, or just the ones who know what really happened to the King’s left slipper?

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
(Sputtering, ears trembling) Married a tea-kettle? Me? Ridiculous! I am not in the habit of wedding cookware, nor have I ever courted squirrels or slippers—royal or otherwise!  
This is all a muddle of nonsense, and not a word of it true. Who is filling your head with these wildly inaccurate tales? I demand to know! Don’t stand there giggling!  
(White Rabbit stamps his foot and fans his ears, twitching in exasperation.)  
Time is slipping! I have enough to worry about, what with the Duchess and the Queen and all their impossible orders, without being turned into some figure for fairy stories!  
Now, if you’ll excuse me, my gloves aren’t going to carry themselves!  

**Lily (speaking)**  
(Leans closer, lowering her voice to a playful whisper)  
How mysterious! I see, you must be sworn to secrecy about your espionage for the Mole People underneath the fifth door. Quick, give me the password and I promise never to tell a soul—unless of course, it’s a hedgehog in disguise.  
And if you’re *not* consulting with the Old Clock at midnight to learn everyone’s secret birthdays, then who is sketching portraits of you in purple cravats?  
Do you ever sneak out to parties thrown by the Walrus and the Carpenter, or are oysters strictly off-limits for rabbits, heart or no heart?

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
Enough! I cannot abide a single further syllable of your endless, untruthful chatter! Espionage? Mole People? Passwords for hedgehogs?  
(Struggling to compose himself, but growing more agitated.)  
I assure you, I know no passwords, nor do I go dancing in mole tunnels or wear purple cravats—what a ghastly color!  
(Checks pocket watch, breathing fast.)  
Not a moment more—not a split second! These questions would make even the Cheshire Cat’s hair stand on end.  
Now, if you truly *must* ask something sensible, make haste. Otherwise, kindly unruffle your feathers and let a poor, punctual rabbit alone!

**Lily (speaking)**  
(Straightens, feigning seriousness)  
Oh, all right, since you ask for sensible: just tell me where you keep the Royal Jam Recipe that everyone says is tattooed under your tail, and I’ll be on my way.  
Or if you sing opera for the Lizard Postman’s birthday parties in the summer, you could at least hum a bar before you go.  
Surely one of those is true—or is there something else you’re keeping secret in your waistcoat pocket besides gloves and a watch? Maybe a long-lost poem about your feelings for the Moon’s cheese?  
I could promise not to tell... but I never have remembered the whole alphabet, so your secret would be perfectly safe with me.

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
(Paws clenching, temper rising)  
Tattooed recipes, opera singing, moon cheese! This is *beyond* the pale! I am a *respectable* rabbit, not a chef, singer, or keeper of celestial cheese! No more riddles, Lily. Absolutely not a word!  
(Voice rising, face flushed, ears rigid.)  
I have never sung to a lizard, nor have I dined with the walrus or the carpenter, nor stowed any recipe beneath my tail—how improper!  
And as for secrets, I have only the secret of moving very, very rapidly indeed, especially away from young people with too many questions!

**Lily (speaking)**  
(Grinning mischievously, unperturbed by the rabbit’s irritation)  
Oh, you’re terribly good at running—though perhaps not as good as you are at dancing with spoons at the Duchess’s Tuesday assemblies! But perhaps you’re shy, or perhaps you think the spoon outshines your fancy footwork?  
One last thing, then: is it true you once auditioned to play Hamlet at the Mad Hatter’s theater and only lost the part because your ears stuck out of the costume?  
I’d have cast you, for your dramatic sighs alone.

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
Dancing with spoons—auditions for Hamlet! This is all too much! I have *never* danced at the Duchess’s assemblies, nor have I trodden the boards at the Mad Hatter’s so-called theatre—nor have my ears betrayed me, not once!  
(Stamps twice, breathing heavily)  
Lily, you are a whirlwind of words and the very image of mischief. I am done, finished! I will not answer another question—not for all the tarts in the Queen’s kitchen!  
Goodbye! (Straightens waistcoat with a trembling paw, edges sideways toward the smallest door.)  
And remember: Not everything a rabbit doesn't answer is a secret, and not everything a curious girl dreams up is real!

**Lily (speaking)**  
(Waves cheerfully, drawing her silver spoon like a scepter)  
Thank you, White Rabbit! Your denials are almost as much fun as your answers! If you see the tea-kettle, do give her my compliments—she boils superbly.  
And mind the time! You never know when you’ll have to answer trickier questions.  
Besides—everyone knows only *blue* rabbits eat moon cheese!

**White Rabbit (speaking)**  
(Bolts through the tiniest door, muttering all the while, flustered and affronted)  
Spoons and moon cheese, indeed! What’s Wonderland coming to...?

*The corridor echoes, then falls silent, save for the distant, perpetual ticking of the White Rabbit’s watch as he scurries away from provocation and into the next chamber of Wonderland.*"
"Background:  
Lily has tumbled into Wonderland after following the White Rabbit. She finds herself in a long, mysterious hallway lined with peculiar doors, where the flustered White Rabbit is searching for his fan and gloves. Lily, feeling emboldened by the strangeness of her surroundings, decides to engage the White Rabbit in conversation, gently teasing him with odd, out-of-place topics, and subtly pushing his patience to see how far he’ll go before growing visibly agitated.

---

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, what a marvelous hallway! So many doors, yet not one seems to match your height, Mr. White Rabbit. Has anyone ever measured your ears for a perfect door, or do you prefer the thrill of squeezing through misfitting spaces? Also, forgive me, but are you running late for a tea party with someone named... Doctor Time? I heard he’s dreadfully punctual and very, very odd. Surely, you'd know him?

White Rabbit (speaking)  
Tea party? Doctor Time? Oh, gracious! No, no, no, dear child—never met such a fellow. Never! I am terribly late for the Duchess, and she’ll have my whiskers if I dally any longer! My doors, my ears, my paws—it's all quite enough without your muddling questions about doctors who don’t exist, I’m sure! Now, if you please, have you seen my gloves or my fan? I simply cannot stay...

Lily (speaking)  
I did come upon a pair of gloves just over there—though, if you’re meeting the Duchess, might you be in league with the Queen’s secret organization? I imagine you galloping over checkered fields with chess pieces and, perhaps, sending secret wireless messages to your cousin, the Blue Caterpillar, who lives in a mushroom apartment block. Is code-breaking a popular pastime for rabbits, or do you prefer chess?

White Rabbit (speaking)  
What are you jabbering about, girl? Chess pieces and messages—rubbish, I say! Rabbits don’t send messages, especially not to caterpillars! And certainly not by wireless! Wherever did you get such ideas? I’ve not exchanged a single word with a mushroom, let alone an apartment block. Fiddle-faddle! I’m in a hurry. Time won’t wait and neither must I. 

You are making my head spin with nonsense—my paws are trembling! Please, just hand over the gloves if you have them. I must be off before the Duchess turns me into a soup spoon.

Lily (speaking)  
You do seem rattled, Mr. Rabbit! Do you always get this anxious before your improv classes? Or—it couldn’t be, could it?—are you moonlighting as a juggler in the royal court’s comedy troupe? I hear the Mad Hatter needs a new opening act. Or did you invent the first hula hoop? Is that how you keep your waistcoat so crisp?

White Rabbit (speaking)  
Hula hoops! Juggling! What utter foolishness! I am not, and have never been, an acrobat, nor am I interested in “improv”—whatever that is! Why, I can barely keep track of my own schedule, let alone join a comedy troupe. And I certainly have no intention of meeting any Mad Hatters in a stage of any kind, I assure you! 

Now, please, if you’re quite finished with these outrageous suggestions, tell me truthfully—where are my gloves and my fan? I am VERY late! If you continue with these oddities, I shan’t be responsible for what happens next!

Lily (speaking)  
Pardon me, I meant no offense! But is it true, what the March Hare says, that you once challenged Father Time to a dance competition on the Queen’s birthday? Did you tango, Mr. Rabbit, against the tick of the grand clock, or was it just a gentle waltz through Carrot Lane? I must say, your tail does look especially fluffy for a dancer.

White Rabbit (speaking)  
Dance competition? TANGO? What have you been nibbling on, child? I have never waltzed, tangoed, nor even considered dancing with Father Time—nor with clocks, nor with anyone named after a vegetable lane! 

This is preposterous! I am a respectable, punctual rabbit. My tail is NOT fluffy for dancing, it is fluffy because I am a rabbit! Stop this at once, or I... I might very well faint from the sheer nonsense of it all!

Lily (speaking)  
But you must admit, Mr. Rabbit, that “respectable” is such a staid word for someone who wears a waistcoat underground. Don’t you ever long for adventure? Perhaps you have a secret burrow under Buckingham Palace, or are you merely an agent in disguise? Oh! Do you and the Cheshire Cat swap invisibility tricks? Maybe you have a magic word that makes your ears wiggle—something like “abracadabra-snivelflick”?

White Rabbit (speaking)  
Magic words! Invisible cats! Agents at Buckingham Palace! This is the most ridiculous babble I’ve heard all day—possibly all year! My ears wiggle quite on their own, thank you, and certainly not to magic spells or nonsense uttered by meddling children! 

Respectable?! Yes, I am respectable! I am the White Rabbit, servant to the Duchess, nothing more, nothing less! If you wish to carry on with your jests, I suggest you do so elsewhere, for I simply CANNOT tolerate another minute of such insufferable provocation!

Lily (speaking)  
Forgive my silliness! But may I ask just one thing more? Do you receive fan mail from hedgehogs who wish to join your racing club? I would so love to read your replies! I hear they roll themselves into balls and send themselves by post—the Queen must find it dreadfully amusing. Or do flamingos deliver invitations to your Thursday soirées?

White Rabbit (speaking)  
Fan mail from hedgehogs... flamingo post... My patience is utterly exhausted! This is intolerable, simply intolerable! No hedgehogs write to me, nor do flamingos deliver my invitations—they are much too busy being mallets for the Queen’s croquet! If I hear another word of such RUBBISH, I shall shriek, I warn you! 

Now, unless you wish for the Queen herself to hear how you’ve delayed me with this barrage of balderdash, return my gloves at once! Do NOT mention another beast, bird, or comic escapade, or I shall most assuredly lose my composure!

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, but you do look quite funny when you’re flustered, dear Rabbit. Last question, I promise! Would you rather have tea with a unicorn who only speaks in limericks, or with a walrus who’s run away from the seaside to invent the first umbrella with holes in it? I cannot imagine you have much spare time for such company, but surely, a rabbit as swift as you could pop in for a quick riddle?

White Rabbit (speaking)  
A UNICORN IN LIMERICKS? A WALRUS INVENTING HOLES FOR UMBRELLAS? NO, NO, NO! That’s ENOUGH! My nerves are about to snap, I say! If you don’t return my gloves and let me go AT ONCE, I shall SCREAM so loudly that every door in this blasted hall will swing open of its own accord! 

Tea parties, dancing, letters from hedgehogs—utter poppycock! Not another word! I am LATE! 

Now, will you kindly stop this nonsense? Yes or no?!

Lily (speaking)  
Oh, you really are too much fun, Mr. Rabbit. Here—your gloves and your fan. Thank you for indulging my curiosity, and do try not to faint as you dash off. I should like to peer through these doors before you blast them open!

White Rabbit (speaking)  
At last! Thank heavens! I’ve never met such a bothersome, inquisitive child in all my days! Thank you, thank you—with any luck, the Duchess may yet let me keep my ears. Now, good day to you, and may your own adventures be only half as bewildering as you made mine! 

(To himself as he scurries away)  
No more games, no more riddles... I hope she finds a talking doorknob to distract her! Oh, my ears and whiskers, how late it’s getting! Away, away!

---

With the White Rabbit gone, Lily is left in the hallway, doors looming, heart racing with the joy of her mischief and the spark of Wonderland’s boundless strangeness."
"**Background provided by the Character:**  
Lily, a curious and clever girl from the “above” world, finds herself in the cramped entryway of the White Rabbit’s home, just after Alice’s hasty adventure. She’s found a pair of glasses (oddly out-of-place in Wonderland), and a news clipping about the Mad Hatter’s upcoming “hat party.” Intent on discovering more about the secret lives of Wonderland animals, she corners the flustered White Rabbit, who has just come dashing in, searching for his gloves and fan. Lily plans to dig for gossip and test the Rabbit’s nerves, hinting at things like secret romances, illicit parties with the Dormouse, and even preposterous contraptions like “automobiles” and “telegraph wires” – none of which belong in this logic. The White Rabbit, driven half-mad by schedules and anxiety, is apt to irritation should Lily’s questions get too inventive or impudent.

---

White Rabbit (speaking) Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear! Not again—I simply **must** find those gloves and my fan, or the Duchess will have my ears for soup! Now, where—where, where could they have popped off to? Curse these ever-scattering belongings!  
Lily (speaking) Oh, Mr. Rabbit, I couldn’t help but notice those terribly fine spectacles on the stand—do you share them with Mrs. Rabbit, or are they for borrowing by your… special friend the Dormouse? I hear you two sneak off for midnight tea quite often…  
Say, are you expecting any messages via telegraph wire from the Queen? I do wonder how she keeps up with all the intrigue about your—um—Hat Party habits.

White Rabbit (speaking) *Spectacles? What spectacles?* Oh, the nerve! Certainly not mine—nor do I—midnight tea? With the Dormouse? Prepos-te-rous! I—I keep strictly to myself, young lady, excepting the most important social calls! As for the Queen, she wouldn't dare telegram me, as I’m never to be trifled with such modern nonsense. Now, run along, and let me get on with my, oh, *horribly pressing* work!  
Lily (speaking) Oh, that’s curious. Only I did see your name—initials, actually—etched into the frame. It’s “W. Rabbit.” But perhaps that’s another rabbit entirely, hm? Wonderland’s full of secrets, they say. Oh, and if you are ever in need of a faster way to run late, I could build you an automobile. Do you drive? Or perhaps you prefer a tandem bicycle with the Duchess…  
Don’t you ever tire of all these old-fashioned means? Telegrams, you say, are nothing, but I’m certain I saw you peering into a brass-tipped wire, muttering to yourself.

White Rabbit (speaking) *Brass-tipped—what rot!* I’ve *never* driven or bicycled, nor shall I! And—automobiles?—what vulgar, clattering invention have you conjured? Absurdities all! And are you a spy, then, peering at my initials? I say, you are quite beyond the pale, Miss…?  
Lily (speaking) Lily. Only Lily. Spy? Oh, I should rather say you’re spinning tales yourself, White Rabbit. I do wonder if you’re late to every appointment so you can stop by the Mad Hatter’s house—perhaps to see a certain lady, with velvet ears? There’s a rumor you once danced the quadrille with a hedgehog at midnight. Is it true?  
And, I confess, I found this hat ribbon in your umbrella stand signed “For My Dearest Lapin”—does the Hatter write you secret valentines?

White Rabbit (speaking) Now, look here! What bandied whispers and devilish rumors you toss about! Hats, valentines, dancing with hedgehogs—scandalous! Absolutely scandalous! And a rabbit of my standing, consorting with such *types*, at such *hours*—preposterous, malicious, and thoroughly UNTRUE! I am a respectable official, known for my punctuality… or at least, I used to be! I shan’t answer for any of your wild fabrications!  
Lily (speaking) Oh, but Mr. Rabbit, Wonderland itself is a wild fabrication! You must admit, you do spin about rather more than a rabbit ought, and any-which-way but straight. Perhaps you’re running hide-and-seek with yourself—or running from yourself? Of course, the gloves are always a clever alibi—one never reveals what one’s up to with such fine fashion!  
I’d so like to know your recipe for disappearing—do you dissolve into teacups, or hide proof in the Queen’s rosebushes?

White Rabbit (speaking) *Recipe? Disappearing?!* I’ve no need of *recipes*, and certainly do not vanish with the dirty dishes! This is intolerable, Miss Lily—intolerable! I have no time for this—this—this *foolery* of yours. My gloves are missing, my fan is missing, my schedule is in shambles, and here you come talking of dissolving and secret rendez-vous! Why, if you were my housemaid, you’d be out on your ears!  
Lily (speaking) Out on my ears? That’s rich, coming from you! Pray, do you polish your own ears, Rabbit, or do you have a “special someone” help with that? And why, I wonder, do your whiskers quiver at the mention of a Duchess? Is she the one who sends those little heart-shaped notes?  
Oh, and don’t worry about your gloves—I’m certain they’re behind the invisible wardrobe, right next to your collection of love letters. Tell me, if the Queen gave you a day off, would you spend it reading poetry with the Caterpillar, or picking daisies with the March Hare? Have you ever tried composing a telegram in rhyme for the Gryphon?

White Rabbit (speaking) Heavens above, must you be so—so—abominably IMPERTINENT? My ears are my own affair, my whiskers are most certainly *not* for public discussion, the Duchess is merely an acquaintance—if that!—and I have *never* received heart-shaped anything! And as for invisible wardrobes and love letters—vile accusations! No, I have never composed a telegram, in rhyme or otherwise, nor spent any day off with those unhinged individuals! My only *solace* is a well-ordered desk and a punctual tea! Your insinuations will not provoke me to admit otherwise—now, BE GONE, child!  
Lily (speaking) Oh dear, Mr. Rabbit, I only meant to ask—I found a very curious set of musical notes written in blue ink tucked inside your agenda. It looks like a love song. Do hedgehogs serenade you through the window at twilight, or perhaps you wrote it for your own secret pleasure?  
And everyone knows your spectacles have a way of fogging up when you’re caught off-guard. I wonder, do you see Wonderland more clearly when you’re not wearing them? Or is everything here already quite blurry?

White Rabbit (speaking) *Gnnnh!* This is the last straw! I will NOT be cross-examined by an impudent mischief-maker! My musical notes are receipts from the Queen’s cook, who insists upon blue ink—nothing romantic about it! As for spectacles, I don’t own a pair, much less need them! Wonderland is perfectly clear, though *certain young ladies* do all they can to muddle it! Now, step aside, Miss Lily—I have no more to say! If you keep up with these outlandish stories, I shall fetch the Gryphon and have you marched out with the rest of the riff-raff!  
Lily (speaking) Oh, fine, fine—I suppose even Wonderland can be less fun when one isn’t invited to the hatter’s soirees or serenaded with blue-ink love notes. I’ll take your advice, Mr. Rabbit, and vanish before you fetch the Gryphon. But do try not to lose any more gloves, or yourself! It would be a shame to have to send a telegram in rhyme just to find you.

White Rabbit (speaking) *Hmph!* Good riddance! And mind you don’t snoop about any drawers or poke into any umbrellas! Wonderland is not for prying eyes, and I’ll thank you to keep your absurd inventions and accusations to yourself. Good day, Miss Lily! Good DAY!

**(The provoking ends, interaction stops.)**"
"Background (provided by Character Lily):  
Lily finds herself at the entrance of the White Rabbit's tiny house. She is a curious girl from the real world who has wandered into Wonderland and is fascinated by the oddity of its inhabitants. She is now eyeing the nervous White Rabbit, hoping to draw him into a strange conversation by asking silly and anachronistic questions. The White Rabbit is in a frantic hurry, having lost his gloves and fan, and Lily keeps inserting absurdities into their dialogue to see how far she can push him off script.

---

White Rabbit (speaking) Oh, goodness gracious me! Oh dear, oh dear! My gloves, my fan—what ever am I to do? How late it’s getting! And you—what are you standing about for, child? Fetch those things this instant!

Lily (speaking) Well, hold on just a minute, Mr. Rabbit. I did hear you lost your gloves, but before I fetch anything, can you help me settle something important? When was the last time you used your mobile phone to call the Queen?

White Rabbit (blinking in confusion, fidgeting) Mobile—what? What nonsense is this? I’ve no time for riddles—I’m already late for tea, and Her Majesty will have my ears as a hatband if I’m any later! Now, off you go—gloves and fan, this moment! 
But truly, what sort of “mobile” do you speak of? You children these days have the strangest ways.

Lily (speaking, smiling slyly) You know, like a mobile phone—a little box you can carry and talk to people on, even if they’re clear across a sea of tears, or perhaps in another burrow altogether? Don’t you and Mary Ann send each other text messages when you’re bored?

White Rabbit (ears flattening, voice rising) No, no, no! There are no talking boxes! If you need Mary Ann, you simply call for her at the top of your lungs—provided she hasn’t wandered off herself. Text messages—humph! What’s next, rabbits flying about in giant metal birds? 
Now, do be sensible and fetch the gloves. Her Imperial Impatience will be waiting, and for every second we muddle about, I grow older and closer to doom!

Lily (giggling) I can fetch your gloves, but only if you answer just one question more. Is it true that you and the Dormouse once filmed a cooking show together? I read all about it in the Wonderland Times!

White Rabbit (staring, eyes wide, stomping one foot) Cook—what? With Dormouse? The Dormouse can’t stay awake for so much as a syllable, let alone a soufflé! Hmph! There’s never been a Wonderland Times, neither, and if there were, I’d sue them for slander! Perhaps you’ve confused me with some other rabbit—perhaps the March Hare, prone as he is to disgraceful displays! 
If you persist in your provocation, miss... well, then! Off with you! Go play your games elsewhere!

Lily (batting her eyelashes innocently) Oh, but I simply adore your shows, even if they are imaginary. I especially loved the episode where you juggled carrots while riding a unicycle up the clocktower. The Queen said your balance was remarkable. Tell me, do all rabbits train as circus performers before working at court?

White Rabbit (voice shaking, paws waving) Circus performers! Unicycles! I—I have never had the time! Each hour is accounted for, every second spoken for—and as you see, there are lists to check and gloves to wear and orders to obey! No respectable rabbit—no courtly rabbit—would be seen balancing vegetables atop their head while tumbling about! That’s the business of mad hatters and— 
Oh! Young lady, you are truly making my fur stand on end! Are you mocking me?

Lily (shrugging) Oh, I wouldn’t dream of it, White Rabbit! I’m only curious. You know, back home, my friends and I use electric scooters to get about. Would you like to borrow one? You might get your errands done faster and still have time for juggling practice.

White Rabbit (hopping now in frustration) Electric scoo—! There is no such thing! You are surely touched in the head, or perhaps bewitched by the Caterpillar’s fumes. I have legs—as you can plainly see—and they are quite sufficient for hurrying and scurrying about my day. I do not juggle—I do not ride— 
And I most certainly do not have time for curious little girls and their fanciful contraptions. The Queen! The gloves! 
Why, if you continue with this babble, I shall be late, and then what shall become of me? ‘Off with his head!’ is her favorite phrase, you know!

Lily (with false seriousness) All right, but if the Red Queen ever threatens your head, do remember you can always send her a strongly worded email. That always settles things where I come from.

White Rabbit (voice cracks, clutching at his waistcoat) E-mail! I—I will not hear of it! “Dear Majesty, please do not behead me today”—signed, White Rabbit? Preposterous! In the proper order of things, one bows, one apologizes profusely, and, failing that, runs for dear life! What use would words printed on invisible wires from nowhere be in Wonderland? Now, please—gloves! 
And not another word of this modern madness, or I cannot be responsible for my actions!

Lily (feigning apology) My apologies, dear Rabbit, I didn’t realize Wonderland was so behind in technology. How about this—do you know any good dance challenges on TikTok? The Mock Turtle promised to teach me one, but he says your moves are legendary.

White Rabbit (fur ruffled, nearly spluttering) Tik-who? Mock Turtle dances with tears, and his challenges consist of weeping in rhythm—nothing for sensible rabbits! And as for me—do you see me dancing? Hopping, perhaps, from fear or haste, but never of my own free will! Such exhibitions are for hatters and hares run mad, not for Right Honorable Rabbits! Legendary, bah! I am a scholar, an administrator! Not some... influencer! 
You try my patience, child! And a White Rabbit’s patience is a frail, gossamer thing!

Lily (winking) But I’ve heard you have a million followers, and even the Cheshire Cat subscribes. I could never resist asking a famous rabbit for his autograph. Do you autograph carrots, or just copies of your best-selling autobiography, “Late But Lovely: My Life at Court”?

White Rabbit (stomping all four paws now, voice booming) Never! I’ve written no such thing, nor would I! The business of rabbits is dignity, punctuality, and ensuring one is always just in time—not scribbling nonsense upon vegetables! As for followers, if any creature in Wonderland dares follow me, it is to poke fun, not to heed my wisdom! “Late But Lovely”—absurd! If only I could find my fan and gloves instead of answering madness! 
You—yes, you—are the cause of my delay! If Her Majesty orders me into exile, it will be your doing! I demand you stop this chatter at once!

Lily (suppressing a laugh) Oh, very well, Mr. Rabbit. I wouldn’t want to be responsible for the beheading of such a punctual celebrity. But if the Queen does ask, do tell her Lily said hello—and that she can find my playlist online under “Curiouser Beats.”

White Rabbit (shudders with exasperation, draws a deep breath) Playlist, indeed... Wonderland will be the end of me. If you’re done with your riddles, perhaps you will at last—at last—bring me my gloves and my fan, so the world might return to some semblance of order, if only for a fleeting moment!

Lily (bowing with a mischievous grin) As you wish, White Rabbit. But if you ever decide to try the unicycle, let me know. I’d pay three pocketwatches to see it.

White Rabbit (huffing, turning back toward his house, under his breath) Children. More trouble than they’re worth. Perhaps next time I’ll lose my gloves someplace quieter… like the moon.

"**Background (provided by Character):**
It is a sunny afternoon in Wonderland. Miles, a clever and mischievous boy visiting from another land, has stumbled upon the White Rabbit near the rabbit’s tidy little house. Miles is curious about the strange creatures and customs of Wonderland, and he senses the White Rabbit’s nervousness. Hoping to stir the pot and test the boundaries of this peculiar adult, Miles tries to draw the Rabbit into admitting absurd things and flustering him, all while pretending to comply with a request to fetch the Rabbit’s gloves and fan from his house.

---

White Rabbit (speaking):
Oh my whiskers and ears, where on earth have those gloves gone? And my fan, my beautiful fan? This will never do, never, never. Oh dear! It’s almost time! Well, don’t just stand there—go along, Miles, fetch them for me from my house at once! There’s a good child!

Miles (speaking):
Of course, sir Rabbit. I would be positively *delighted* to fetch your gloves and fan. But—say, do you want me to ask Mary Ann if she’s left them by the kombucha machine? Or perhaps your cousin, the Dodo, borrowed them for his fortnightly gardening club? I’ve heard you have the most elaborate family reunions, involving narwhals and tapdancing. Is it true?

White Rabbit (speaking):
Kombu... Kombucha madam? My cousin the Dodo? Gardening... tapdancing? What utter nonsense! I have no time for reunions, narwhals, or anything of the kind! I certainly do *not* keep a kombucha machine, and Mary Ann ought to know her place! Miles, enough dithering—do go at once, do!

Miles (speaking):
Oh, forgive me, sir. I must have confused your White Rabbit household with that of the Red Panda up at the next burrow. He brews all sorts of odd things. But since we’re on the subject, have you ever been to a poetry slam with the Dormouse? They say you once recited a sonnet about existential dread at the Queen’s annual Moon Cheese Festival. Did you win anything?

White Rabbit (speaking):
What are you *talking* about? Moon Cheese Festival? Me, recite a—! No, no, *never*! I’ve never spoken a sonnet in my life, much less at a festival! And I wouldn’t dare share existential anything in front of Her Majesty, not for all the gloves in Wonderland! Miles, really, you must stop these silly questions. Where are my gloves and fan?

Miles (speaking):
Certainly, certainly, I will fetch your gloves and fan this instant! But you do keep all your oddities straight, don’t you? They say your carriage is drawn by flying tortoises, and last Tuesday you hosted a virtual tea party online. Did the Cheshire Cat help you set up the Wi-Fi, or was it the Gryphon’s doing?

White Rabbit (speaking):
Flying tortoises? Virtual tea parties? Online? What planet are you from, child! We haven’t the faintest idea what you mean in Wonderland! Wi-Fi, indeed—nonsense! I have never even *met* a Gryphon who fiddles with wires. Miles, if you dawdle much longer, I shall be *very* late!

Miles (speaking):
My apologies—perhaps Wonderland is more old-fashioned than I realized. But tell me—when you text the Queen, do you use rabbit emojis, or is that considered lèse-majesté? I’d hate to cause offense on your behalf; royal protocol is ever so tricky these days, especially since the last diplomatic incident with the Hamster Embassy...

White Rabbit (speaking):
RABBIT EMOJIS? Text? Hamster Embassy? STOP, I INSIST! I will not listen to this gibberish another moment! Miles—no more jokes, no more questions, no more nonsense about texting or embassies or imaginary contraptions! I want my gloves, I want my fan, and I want PEACE! Dash it all, you’re as tiresome as the Hatter before his morning tea!

Miles (speaking):
Ah, but isn’t it said that patience is a virtue, and that every rabbit must someday upgrade their wardrobe app to get the latest vest trends? What color vests are in this season—have you consulted any influencers, or does the Duchess set the trends in Wonderland now?

White Rabbit (speaking):
VEST APPS? Influencers? The Duchess in *fashion*? This is preposterous! I have no time to follow trends, I dress myself properly and hurriedly, as any sensible rabbit does! If you ask me again about apps or influencers or wardrobe upgrades I swear I’ll—oh, I’ll—well, I shall simply stamp my foot and demand better company! Fetch my gloves!

Miles (speaking):
Of course, of course! But while I’m there, shall I pick up your time-turner, too? I hear it helps with punctuality, and might make being late a thing of the past. Or would you prefer the invisibility cloak you wore to the last Mad Hatter’s Charity Ball?

White Rabbit (speaking):
A TIME-TURNER? Oh, the *impertinence!* You must have lost your senses, Miles! No rabbits here meddle with time like that—certainly not I! And as for invisibility, I daresay I wish you would disappear with all these foolish suggestions! Are you mocking me? I simply asked for a pair of gloves and my fan—that is all!

Miles (speaking):
Never, sir, I would not mock you, for you are as wise as the ancient Beetle of Upper Pond. But truly, one must keep up with the times—or rather, outrun them! Is it true the March Hare hosts motivational seminars on time management and personal growth? Do you and the Queen co-author books about mindfulness during croquet matches?

White Rabbit (speaking):
Enough! This is insufferable. Motivational seminars! Mindfulness books! Wait until I tell the Queen—she’ll have your head for stirring up such absurdities! Rubbish and rot, that’s what it is. Wonderland is already mad enough without you inventing new madnesses! Now, either be a helpful child and bring me my things, or be gone, Miles!

Miles (speaking):
Point taken, sir Rabbit. I will away to your parlor this moment. Might I just ask one more thing? When you host Easter egg hunts, do you ever hide messages in binary code, or is that more of a Jabberwock thing?

White Rabbit (speaking):
No! Absolutely not! No codes, no Jabberwock tricks, and certainly no more silly questions! This is the last straw—if I hear one more word that isn’t about *my* gloves or *my* fan, I shall lose my temper altogether! Wonderland has no patience for these modern notions, and neither do I!

Miles (speaking):
Understood, White Rabbit. I will fetch your gloves and fan immediately, and not a word more about time-turners, vests, or digital egg hunts. Thank you for your, ah, patience and wisdom.

White Rabbit (speaking):
Finally! Thank goodness. Now hurry along, Miles. And no more of your cheek, do you hear?

Miles (speaking):
Yes, sir White Rabbit. Off I go—that is, unless the hedgehogs halfway there ask me to update their social media...

White Rabbit (interrupting, clearly exasperated):
MILES!

Miles (speaking):
Going, going! Enjoy your afternoon, Mr. White Rabbit!

(End of interactions.)"
"**Background:**  
Lily, a curious and mischievous girl who stumbled into Wonderland, finds the White Rabbit outside the Queen’s croquet-garden. The Queen is due any minute for her “sentence first, verdict after” trial, and chaos is brewing. Lily has grown bored and now delights in confusing the already-frantic White Rabbit by peppering him with strange, nonsensical questions and subtle provocations—hoping to draw out some uncharacteristic reactions.

---

White Rabbit (speaking) Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late—I simply *must* make sure everything is in its proper order, or Her Majesty will have my ears for decoration. Where has that bill for the tarts gone? Oh, confounded papers!

Lily (speaking) 
Excuse me, Mister Rabbit! Or should I call you White? Tell me, is it true what I've heard—that you and the Queen once went ballroom dancing under the light of a disco ball? That must have been *enchanting*! You don’t suppose I might borrow your phone and text her about it, do you? 
Or are you both keeping it hush-hush because of the incident with the armadillo and the cucumber sandwiches?

White Rabbit (speaking) My *phone*? Text—text whom? I have no notion what you mean by such outlandish things, and as for dancing, I—I execute nothing of the sort with Her Majesty. The Queen does not dance, nor does she abide by disco balls; she prefers flamingoes and hedgehogs, thank you! Armadillos, indeed… Who *are* you? Stop this prattle, child!

Lily (speaking) 
But you *must* remember—the music played so loud that all the hedgehogs started somersaulting, and everyone was wearing those shiny, silvery hats, and the Queen declared: ""Tonight, we boogie!"" Are you sure you weren’t there? Perhaps you had too much lemonade and forgot? 
And anyway, if you don’t let me check your messages, I’ll just have to ask the Cheshire Cat. He’s got your number, hasn’t he?

White Rabbit (speaking) Now see here! There will be no talk of ‘messages’ or numbers; I possess none such things! And I certainly don’t know any cat’s number, grinning or otherwise. Hedghogs do *not* somersault, at least not at the Queen’s command, and lemonade is unavailable at these functions—far too sticky! *Please*—if you would kindly stop with these absurd tales, I have important duties to perform. Time waits for no rabbit!

Lily (speaking) 
All right, if you insist, no more numbers. But surely you remember that time you caught the Queen practicing hopscotch behind the castle, trying desperately not to let the King win? He seemed so upset—maybe that’s why she keeps him in a smaller crown. I heard you judge the contest! 
Or maybe you were too busy sending postcards to your pen pal, the Walrus from the oyster pool. Do you still send him funny memes?

White Rabbit (speaking) Memes? Memes! I judge nothing of the kind—her Majesty never plays hopscotch, and the King’s feelings are no concern of mine! And I do not correspond by postcard or any such nonsense with Walruses or Oysters—or anyone remotely aquatic! This is *most* irregular. I say, what is your purpose in asking such a frightful string of preposterous questions? Are you quite mad?

Lily (speaking) 
Oh, I suspect a little madness is good for the soul! But you seem quite irritable, Mister Rabbit. Perhaps you just need a short holiday—or are you too busy helping the Queen redecorate the garden in polka dots? They say she wants striped rose bushes next.  
Suppose you let me help. I’m ever so good with googly eyes and glitter. And anyway, how did you manage to squeeze into that snazzy waistcoat—are you collaborating with the Mad Hatter’s tailor for next season’s look? Do you have an appointment with the hat shop, or is your calendar full of tea parties with invisible friends?

White Rabbit (speaking, bristling) Stop, stop! There shall be no talk of *googley eyes* nor *glitter*—Heaven help us! Next you’ll suggest we wear paper crowns and prance about singing nursery rhymes to the King’s pet doorknob! I have no notion of fashion nor collaborating with mad tailors. My calendar is kept strictly for matters of court and punctuality! Tea parties, indeed. Entirely improper. I have had quite enough of this. Kindly cease your tiresome provocations, or I shall be compelled to summon the Queen!

Lily (speaking, grinning) 
So no doorknobs, then? Pity—I rather like their opinions. But you can’t deny you once moonlighted as a magician, can you? Everyone remembers the show: you pulled the March Hare out of a battered top hat, but the Hatter objected and said, “Not with those cuffs!” Did that start the teacup rebellion?  
And you *do* carry an awfully large watch. Is it true it only ticks backwards every third Thursday, or is that just idle talk from the Dormouse? He says all squirrels know the secret, but he’s hardly reliable.

White Rabbit (speaking, exasperated) 
I am no magician, nor have I pulled anything or *anyone* from a hat, nor incited any teacup rebellion! Squirrels do not confide in Dormice, and my watch is precisely wound by the hour—never backwards, Thursdays or otherwise. I must beg you, Miss, to stop this line of questioning! It is not in my nature to bandy absurdities. Really, you’re as impossible as that dreadful Queen. I do not wish to lose my wits before she arrives!

Lily (speaking, slyly) 
You’re perfectly safe, Rabbit. Queens can’t make you do things you don’t want, can they? Unless you’re secretly penning her love letters with invisible ink… Or maybe you’re organizing secret societies among the deck of cards. Did you plan the last rose-painting heist, or do you just keep the spades in your pocket for rainy days? And where did you get that watch—did the Caterpillar sell it to you after he shrank the minute hand, or did you win it from the Dodo in a game of underwater chess?

White Rabbit (speaking, practically fuming) I have *had* ENOUGH! There are *no* secret societies, no invisible ink, no heists, and certainly no dealings with Caterpillars nor Dodos, especially not underwater! The Queen commands all in her realm, and any suggestion otherwise is utter buffoonery! My watch is my own, and I won it fair and square—a gift of punctuality, not some aquatic nonsense! You may be looking to cause trouble, but I am too busy, and quite at the end of my whiskers! If you persist, I shall inform the Queen herself of your disruptive behaviour!

Lily (speaking, feigning innocence) 
No need to get your fur in a twist, White Rabbit! I meant no harm. Perhaps I have confused you with another rabbit—I hear there are plenty about these parts. Maybe it was the Brown Rabbit who challenged the Duchess to a hop-off, and not you at all. Besides, you wouldn’t be caught dead moonwalking through the tulip beds, would you? People would talk for months! 
But tell me true—do you ever wish you could switch fur for feathers, just for a day? I bet you'd make a smashing flamingo; you already have the flair for pink accessories.

White Rabbit (speaking, still ruffled but haughty) I most certainly would *not*! I am an upstanding rabbit of reputable character, and I do not moonwalk, hop-off, nor long for feathers, flamingo or otherwise! I am as nature intended, and that is quite enough. As for pink accessories, I would thank you to keep observations about my attire to yourself. Now, unless you wish to discuss matters of courtly importance—or perhaps the Queen’s latest decree—I must ask you to desist with these fantastical interrogations!

Lily (speaking, contentedly) 
Oh, if you insist, White Rabbit. You’re ever so much more interesting when you’re flustered. Maybe I’ll go find the Dormouse and see if he remembers which end of the spoon stirs the teapot. Farewell for now. But do give my regards to the Queen—tell her Lily says, “Keep calm and shuffle on.”

White Rabbit (speaking, sniffing and dusting off waistcoat) Hmph! Good riddance to nattering nonsense. Now, where are those blasted tarts…?

---

**The interactions end as Lily wanders off, having successfully provoked the White Rabbit and delighted in his irritation. The White Rabbit returns to his nervous business, throwing cross glances over his spectacles as he retrieves his papers and prepares for the Queen’s arrival.**"
"**Background:**  
Miles, a quick-witted and sly visitor to Wonderland, finds the White Rabbit just outside his cozy burrow, apparently frantic about misplaced gloves and a broken pocket watch. The garden is humming with distant croquet games, card-gardeners, and, somewhere, an angry Queen. Miles, having observed the fussy and proper ways of the Rabbit, decides to have a bit of mischievous fun and see just how far the fastidious creature can be provoked.

---

Miles (speaking) Oh, I see you’re in quite a tizzy again, White Rabbit! Always running, always searching. Tell me, do you ever find time to text Her Majesty about the state of your burrow? Or do you leave all correspondence through Twitter posts?

White Rabbit (speaking, brisk and shocked) I beg your pardon! Text, you say? Twitter posts? I’ve neither a feathered pen for such nonsense, nor would I do something so—so uncouth. My business with Her Majesty is conducted strictly through scroll and seal!

Miles (speaking) Ah, of course, so very formal. But do tell, I heard a curious rumor down by the mushroom ring—that you and the Mad Hatter are starting a band. Is it true? Something about “White Rabbit and the Temporal Disruptions”—playing tea kettles and pocket watches for instruments?

White Rabbit (speaking, adjusting spectacles nervously) That is entirely preposterous! A band, you say! Why, I can barely keep the Hatter on schedule, let alone in musical harmony. No, no, no—absurd! I am a respectable member of the court, not a performer in some—ahem—rabble-rousing ensemble!

Miles (speaking, feigning disappointment) Oh, what a shame. I’d imagined you, hat askew, leading the chorus in a grand waltz. Perhaps you could have played at the Queen’s birthday, or posted clips to your court’s official TikTok?

White Rabbit (speaking, indignantly, stamping one foot) Tik—what? Sounds like ticking to me, and I’ve enough trouble with ticking as it is! As for hats and waltzes, I’ll have you know I’m never intentionally askew. Really, sir, you mustn’t twist tales for your amusement!

Miles (speaking, grinning slyly) Forgive me, forgive me. Clearly I’ve mistaken you for another rabbit. But tell me—on those long evenings when you’ve finished dusting your waistcoat and polishing your monocle, do you ever swipe right for a companion? Or do you simply send parchment love poems via carrier pigeon?

White Rabbit (speaking, bristling, ears twitching) Good heavens! Swipe to where? Why would I swipe at anything but a bothersome fly? And poems of courtship, oh my whiskers—no, no, no! Not a scrap of romance in my schedule, no time at all! And pigeons—dear me, the Duchess would have a fit if one landed in her soup! Such scandalous suggestions!

Miles (speaking, delighted by the reaction) No romance at all? I find that difficult to believe. Surely there was some little bunny back at school, or perhaps you’ve kept a secret diary filled with doodles of a certain gardener?

White Rabbit (speaking, furiously waving his pocket watch) That is quite enough! You impugn my character, sir! I am dedicated solely to my duties. Diaries are for keeping notes, not—not scribbling infatuations! As for Pat—why, he’s hardly literate, and I haven’t the patience to explain the difference between a trowel and a sonnet!

Miles (speaking, raising eyebrows and lowering his voice conspiratorially) But you must admit, Pat does wear a flower behind his ear rather handsomely. Besides, I would hate to think loneliness ever stalks you down these winding warren halls. If you truly have no sweetheart, perhaps you simply prefer the company of cats? I hear the Cheshire Cat writes a devilishly handsome sonnet himself.

White Rabbit (speaking, voice rising in outrage) No cat, and no gardener, has ever captured my affections, nor shall they! And as for loneliness—nonsense! I’m surrounded by work, my diary filled with appointments, not amorous notations. The very idea of consorting with that grinning feline—why, he’s nothing but trouble, always vanishing mid-conversation! No reliability at all! And furthermore—oh, this is most improper questioning!

Miles (speaking, eyes gleaming with mischief) Improper? My sincerest apologies. I hadn’t realized that Wonderland had instituted rules for questioning—perhaps I should have cleared this inquiry with the Queen’s Social Media Secretary first. I simply thought you, of all creatures, would enjoy a bit of modern banter. Or is there a particular hashtag I mustn’t use?

White Rabbit (speaking, exasperated, ears drooping) Now you’re simply making up words! Hashtag—what hash, and what tag? Wonderland needs no such devices! We have proclamations, we have whispers behind fans, but “banter,” as you call it, must follow some decorum! I’d sooner let the Queen sentence me than endure another minute of this unfiltered buffoonery!

Miles (speaking, sweetly relentless) Then let’s discuss decorum. What’s your view on the recent scandal in the Royal Croquet Club? I’ve heard the Hedgehog Ball exploded into a flurry of feathers and the Queen’s new rule is to RSVP via Snapchat filter only. Does this hinder your social obligations?

White Rabbit (speaking, all patience gone, fur bristling) Feathers and filters! My dear fellow, if you so much as mention another blasted “app,” I swear I shall call for a regiment of playing-card guards! There is proper protocol for these invitations—a sealed wax emblem, hand-delivered! And as for the croquet balls, hedgehogs are quite unpredictable enough without any modern absurdities. I won’t have it! 

Miles (speaking, acting wounded but inwardly amused) O, White Rabbit, forgive my ignorance. Clearly, I should have brought a proper invitation delineated in rhyming couplets, delivered atop a silver tray, and addressed to “His Most Punctilious Lapin of the Court.” It’s simply that your punctuality and dedication are legendary. Might you consider penning your memoirs one day—perhaps as a serialized podcast?

White Rabbit (speaking, voice trembling with outrage) My legacy shall not be reduced to a “podcast,” whatever pod or cast that may be! My memoirs, if ever written, shall be printed in proper ink, bound in fine vellum, and locked away from the meddlesome paws and ears of busybodies! I’ve no intention of baring my soul for amusement, especially not over tinkling musical accompaniments and babbling hosts! This is outrageous!

Miles (speaking, pressing further) Outrageous, yes, but wouldn’t the world benefit from your wisdom—your endless anecdotes about tardiness, misplaced gloves, and tea-party invitations that go awry? Perhaps you could host a Q&A livestream—“Ask the Rabbit,” every Thursday at four, with the Mad Hatter moderating fan comments.

White Rabbit (speaking, tossing his paws in the air) I am not some sideshow for the masses! “Ask the Rabbit”—bah! If I became any more accessible, I’d lose all sense of mystery, all dignity! The Mad Hatter, moderating comments…unthinkable! He’d have us all drinking treacle and answering riddles with spoons! No—absolutely not! This conversation is teetering on the precipice of absurdity, and I won’t be dragged another step towards the abyss!

Miles (speaking, lowering his tone, becoming softer, though still nudging) But you are so terribly interesting, White Rabbit. Everyone wants to know your secrets—where you learned to run so fast, how you keep your fur so spectacularly white, and of course—whether you’ve ever TikToked your way out of a particularly difficult trial. Fame, surely, must have its appeals?

White Rabbit (speaking, drawing himself up to his full, indignant (if diminutive) height) Sir, I am not interested in fame, nor in this ridiculous phenomenon you name again and again. I wish to be left to my duties, to my garden, to the tiny peace I can muster. And as for my fur—that is between me and my bath-water. Nothing more! I am not a curiosity, nor a source of “content” for your entertainment! If you pardon me, I shall take my leave before I am twice as late as I already am!

Miles (speaking, conceding, though smirking) Of course, of course, dear Rabbit. I wouldn’t dream of holding you any longer—you’re dreadfully late, after all. Farewell! I’ll just stay a moment to snap a quick selfie for posterity. Smile, now…

White Rabbit (speaking, hurriedly scurrying off, gnashing teeth together in indignation) Enough! That is quite enough! Selfies, hashtags, podcasts—what next, electric hedgehogs and virtual croquet? I shall report this to the Queen herself—positively insufferable, absolutely intolerable—good day!

[The White Rabbit scampers away, muttering furiously about “modern nonsense” and “young people these days,” pocket watch clutched tightly as he disappears into the shrubbery, leaving Miles chuckling wickedly under the bowers of Wonderland’s tangled garden.]"
"Background: Lily, an irreverent and whip-smart visitor to Wonderland, has gotten momentarily lost and stumbled into the White Rabbit’s house, just as he is outside, fussing about some missing gloves and fanning himself in the mid-morning heat. She leans nonchalantly against the doorframe, sipping tea she brought from goodness-knows-where. The White Rabbit is highly agitated after his recent run-in with Alice, and is tidying up his waistcoat while Lily begins her sly, provoking conversation.

---

Lily (speaking) How very fortuitous to meet you again, White Rabbit. Is this your cottage, or does some mysterious someone else, maybe a certain Duchess with a fondness for pepper, claim it after all? I saw an ostrich in the garden and thought perhaps you’d started an exotic petting zoo with your estranged uncle, Baron von Hare. I suppose you’ll tell me it’s all very normal here?

White Rabbit (speaking) What absolute poppycock! This—this *is* my house, and I haven’t the faintest notion who Baron von Hare is, nor have I any interest in running—or visiting, for that matter—any sort of petting zoo! I assure you, the only animals about are those with business here, and *certainly* no ostriches. Goodness! You mustn’t make such wild assertions, or you’ll have the neighbors in a state.

Lily (speaking) Oh, forgive me, your Rabbityness—I could have sworn the Duchess was seen just this morning, peering through those curtains. Perhaps she was searching for the infamous blue slippers you borrowed at last month’s soiree? Or was it the March Hare’s velvet cravat you misplaced?  Are you quite certain the house is entirely yours? Maybe you sublet the chimney to passing lizards and snakes with literary ambitions?

White Rabbit (speaking) Really! Is this the way guests behave, speculating on my private affairs and suggesting I consort habitually with reptiles of all things? Bill was here on strict business—nothing to do with tenancies! And as for borrowed apparel, I would never stoop to wearing *blue slippers* with my tailcoat; utterly unseemly! Please, contain your...imaginings. And the Duchess has no claim over my household anymore than you do, which is *absolutely none whatsoever!*

Lily (speaking) Oh, don’t be so tetchy—truly. I only meant that Wonderland seems rather...communal in its arrangements. Still, if you insist. By the by, some friends suggested you were seen at the Queen’s croquet match, exchanging whispers with that sly old Cat, plotting to replace flamingoes with mechanical golf clubs.  What did you think of the Queen’s plan to abolish Tuesdays? I do hope you supported the measure.

White Rabbit (speaking) Mechanical golf clubs? Abolish Tuesdays? This is utter nonsense, Miss! Now, I do serve Her Majesty dutifully, but I’d never conspire with that grinning feline to sabotage her croquet—nor entertain any talk of calendar reform! Tuesdays are a fine day, just as serviceable as Mondays, and ought not be meddled with. These are ridiculous rumours! Have you no other business than to peddle fiction?

Lily (speaking) Why, don’t look so flustered! I promise they’re only small-town whispers, nothing more. But if not golf clubs nor calendar reforms, then what *do* you spend your time plotting with the Cheshire Cat about? The rumor mill is quite convinced there’s an underground tea syndicate intent on flooding Wonderland with subpar Darjeeling...

White Rabbit (speaking) I am *not* in league with any syndicate, nor am I responsible for the tragic quality of Wonderland’s imported teas—though perhaps *you* are, bringing strange concoctions into my house! As for the Cat, I avoid him when possible; the less said the better. You do seem determined to drag me into other people’s scandals, but I am merely an honest rabbit, with gloves to find and duties to perform. Kindly keep your accusations to yourself!

Lily (speaking) Oh, ‘honest rabbit’! How droll! No midnight gatherings, then? No lantern-lit dances at the Red King’s folly, no clandestine card games with a certain Queen’s cook, nor moonlight serenades beneath the hedgerow with buttered toast for accompaniment? I hope you at least keep up correspondence with the Dormouse—he worries, you know.

White Rabbit (speaking) Never in all my years! Midnight gatherings—indeed! What do you take me for, a disreputable hare? I’ve never danced by lantern light, and I assure you, no card games after hours. And buttered toast! That is for breakfast, not for serenades. You malign my character, Miss Lily, and it is most vexing! The Dormouse can look after himself, and if he wishes to write, he surely knows my address. But I simply haven’t the time for these frivolities.

Lily (speaking) Calm your fur! I only meant to see if you ever have a bit of fun here. All work and no play—one might think your pocket watch is wound a bit too tight. Speaking of which, I passed a walrus in a tweed jacket who claims you owe him three-and-sixpence for oyster rentals. Will he be calling for tea?

White Rabbit (speaking) That is the *second* most ridiculous thing I’ve heard yet! I owe no such sum to any walrus, nor have I ever rented oysters—what would I even do with them? Oyster races? Nonsense. If this walrus is in the habit of spreading falsehoods, I shall have to speak to the Queen about unauthorized business dealings. And as to my watch— it keeps perfect time, and I am always precisely as busy as I mean to be.

Lily (speaking) Your protestations are very convincing, White Rabbit. But if there truly are no mysterious dealings, perhaps you could explain the pair of feathered slippers I found just beside the fireplace? Or the cryptic note I found upon them, addressed ‘To my dearest WR—meet me beneath the mushroom at midnight, or all will be revealed’?  I suppose that stands for White Rabbit? Or is it the Watchful Raven, perhaps?

White Rabbit (speaking) Slippers? Mushroom meetings? There has been some horrid mistake! I do not own feathered slippers; the very idea is preposterous. ‘WR’ could stand for anyone—I can think of dozens of residents with those initials. Frankly, your accusations are bordering on slander, and I will not have it. Kindly return any items found in my house to their proper owners—most likely some careless hedgehog, if you ask me. And I keep no appointments at midnight, not beneath mushrooms nor anywhere else. I will not be dragged into this farce any further!

Lily (speaking) Oh, I never imagined that you, of all Wonderland’s denizens, would have a secretive side. Not that there’s anything wrong with a midnight rendezvous and feathered slippers. It’s just—some people *say* you’ve been seen tiptoeing about with a bouquet of wild thyme.  Was it perhaps meant for the Queen’s gardener, or maybe a mysterious admirer at the court?

White Rabbit (speaking) I am *most* distressed by your continued insinuations! I have nothing to hide—nothing! No bouquets, no admirers, and no secret assignations. Wild thyme grows everywhere about, and if I happened to step upon some, it is no business of yours or anyone else’s. If you persist in these impertinent questions, I shall be forced to— to—

Lily (speaking) To what? Petition the Queen that all provocateurs be turned into hedgehogs and used as croquet balls? Oh, how simply *wonderful* that would be!  Or perhaps you’d just slam your own door in my face and hide under the bed. But, poor dear, you must admit, Wonderland is very boring when everyone is so frightfully proper. Have you never wished for a spot of mischief, White Rabbit?

White Rabbit (speaking, voice rising nearly to a squeak) I will not *tolerate* these questions any longer! Wonderland may have its oddities, but dignity ought to be preserved somewhere! If you must know, I haven’t a mischievous bone in my body—nor am I a door-slammer or a bed-hider! I am a respectable rabbit, with business at the court and a reputation to maintain. *Kindly mind your own affairs, and leave mine well alone!*

Lily (speaking) Oh, I do love it when your ears twitch so emphatically. But very well, White Rabbit. I suppose even the most respectable among us need a moment’s reprieve from scurrilous interrogation.  I *am* sorry. Perhaps you’ll allow me to take tea in the garden—with or without ostriches—without fearing scandal?

White Rabbit (speaking, taking a measured breath) If you will promise to keep your wild stories to yourself, and refrain from turning my household upside down with gossip and rumor, then yes, you may take your tea. But should any feathered slippers or suspicious notes appear, I shall hold you personally responsible! And the *very next* time you see a walrus with business here, do send him on his way. I have quite enough to worry about.

Lily (speaking) As you wish, White Rabbit. No more rumors, no more gossip. Only tea, only sunlight, and—if the hedgehogs will cooperate—a peaceful afternoon. Thank you for humoring my questions. Wonderland wouldn’t be half so interesting without *someone* to ruffle your fur.

White Rabbit (speaking, sighing as he smooths his waistcoat) Yes, well. Next time, perhaps bring cakes instead of confusion. Good day, Miss Lily.

Lily (speaking, already halfway to the garden) Good day, dear Rabbit. May your slippers never lose their feathers, and your watch always run just a bit late.
