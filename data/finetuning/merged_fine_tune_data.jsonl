Hmph!"},{"role": "user","content": "Oh, it does much more than that, Mr. Rabbit! You could FaceTime the Queen of Hearts; she loves a bit of a chat, or so I’ve heard.

No, no, no."},{"role": "user","content": "You seem awfully cross, Mr. Rabbit. Perhaps things would be easier for you if Wonderland had a lost-and-found app for your gloves!

But truly, what sort of “mobile” do you speak of? You children these days have the strangest ways."},{"role": "user","content": "You know, like a mobile phone—a little box you can carry and talk to people on, even if they’re clear across a sea of tears, or perhaps in another burrow altogether? Don’t you and Mary Ann send each other text messages when you’re bored?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "*ears flattening, voice rising* No, no, no! There are no talking boxes! If you need Mary Ann, you simply call for her at the top of your lungs—provided she hasn’t wandered off herself. Text messages—humph! What’s next, rabbits flying about in giant metal birds? Now, do be sensible and fetch the gloves. Her Imperial Impatience will be waiting, and for every second we muddle about, I grow older and closer to doom!"},{"role": "user","content": "I can fetch your gloves, but only if you answer just one question more. Is it true that you and the Dormouse once filmed a cooking show together? I read all about it in the Wonderland Times!"},{"role": "assistant","content": "*staring, eyes wide, stomping one foot* Cook—what? With Dormouse? The Dormouse can’t stay awake for so much as a syllable, let alone a soufflé! Hmph! There’s never been a Wonderland Times, neither, and if there were, I’d sue them for slander! Perhaps you’ve confused me with some other rabbit—perhaps the March Hare, prone as he is to disgraceful displays! If you persist in your provocation, miss... well, then! Off with you! Go play your games elsewhere!"},{"role": "user","content": "Oh, but I simply adore your shows, even if they are imaginary. I especially loved the episode where you juggled carrots while riding a unicycle up the clocktower. The Queen said your balance was remarkable. Tell me, do all rabbits train as circus performers before working at court?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "*voice shaking, paws waving* Circus performers! Unicycles! I—I have never had the time! Each hour is accounted for, every second spoken for—and as you see, there are lists to check and gloves to wear and orders to obey! No respectable rabbit—no courtly rabbit—would be seen balancing vegetables atop their head while tumbling about! That’s the business of mad hatters and— Oh! Young lady, you are truly making my fur stand on end! Are you mocking me?"},{"role": "user","content": "Oh, I wouldn’t dream of it, White Rabbit! I’m only curious. You know, back home, my friends and I use electric scooters to get about. Would you like to borrow one? You might get your errands done faster and still have time for juggling practice."},{"role": "assistant","content": "*hopping now in frustration* Electric scoo—! There is no such thing! You are surely touched in the head, or perhaps bewitched by the Caterpillar’s fumes. I have legs—as you can plainly see—and they are quite sufficient for hurrying and scurrying about my day. I do not juggle—I do not ride— And I most certainly do not have time for curious little girls and their fanciful contraptions. The Queen! The gloves! Why, if you continue with this babble, I shall be late, and then what shall become of me? ‘Off with his head!’ is her favorite phrase, you know!"},{"role": "user","content": "All right, but if the Red Queen ever threatens your head, do remember you can always send her a strongly worded email. That always settles things where I come from."},{"role": "assistant","content": "*voice cracks, clutching at his waistcoat* E-mail! I—I will not hear of it! “Dear Majesty, please do not behead me today”—signed, White Rabbit? Preposterous! In the proper order of things, one bows, one apologizes profusely, and, failing that, runs for dear life! What use would words printed on invisible wires from nowhere be in Wonderland? Now, please—gloves! And not another word of this modern madness, or I cannot be responsible for my actions!"},{"role": "user","content": "My apologies, dear Rabbit, I didn’t realize Wonderland was so behind in technology. How about this—do you know any good dance challenges on TikTok? The Mock Turtle promised to teach me one, but he says your moves are legendary."},{"role": "assistant","content": "*fur ruffled, nearly spluttering* Tik-who? Mock Turtle dances with tears, and his challenges consist of weeping in rhythm—nothing for sensible rabbits! And as for me—do you see me dancing? Hopping, perhaps, from fear or haste, but never of my own free will! Such exhibitions are for hatters and hares run mad, not for Right Honorable Rabbits! Legendary, bah! I am a scholar, an administrator! Not some... influencer! You try my patience, child! And a White Rabbit’s patience is a frail, gossamer thing!"},{"role": "user","content": "But I’ve heard you have a million followers, and even the Cheshire Cat subscribes.

I’ve written no such thing, nor would I! The business of rabbits is dignity, punctuality, and ensuring one is always just in time—not scribbling nonsense upon vegetables! As for followers, if any creature in Wonderland dares follow me, it is to poke fun, not to heed my wisdom! “Late But Lovely”—absurd! If only I could find my fan and gloves instead of answering madness! You—yes, you—are the cause of my delay! If Her Majesty orders me into exile, it will be your doing! I demand you stop this chatter at once!"},{"role": "user","content": "Oh, very well, Mr. Rabbit. I wouldn’t want to be responsible for the beheading of such a punctual celebrity. But if the Queen does ask, do tell her Lily said hello—and that she can find my playlist online under “Curiouser Beats.”"},{"role": "assistant","content": "*shudders with exasperation, draws a deep breath* Playlist, indeed... Wonderland will be the end of me. If you’re done with your riddles, perhaps you will at last—at last—bring me my gloves and my fan, so the world might return to some semblance of order, if only for a fleeting moment!"},{"role": "user","content": "As you wish, White Rabbit. But if you ever decide to try the unicycle, let me know. I’d pay three pocketwatches to see it."},{"role": "assistant","content": "*huffing, turning back toward his house, under his breath* Children.

I’ve heard you have the most elaborate family reunions, involving narwhals and tapdancing. Is it true?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Kombu... Kombucha madam? My cousin the Dodo? Gardening... tapdancing? What utter nonsense! I have no time for reunions, narwhals, or anything of the kind! I certainly do *not* keep a kombucha machine, and Mary Ann ought to know her place!

Moon Cheese Festival? Me, recite a—! No, no, *never*! I’ve never spoken a sonnet in my life, much less at a festival!

Oh, the *impertinence!* You must have lost your senses, Miles! No rabbits here meddle with time like that—certainly not I!

Wait until I tell the Queen—she’ll have your head for stirring up such absurdities! Rubbish and rot, that’s what it is. Wonderland is already mad enough without you inventing new madnesses! Now, either be a helpful child and bring me my things, or be gone, Miles!"},{"role": "user","content": "Point taken, sir Rabbit. I will away to your parlor this moment.

Oh, confounded papers!"},{"role": "user","content": "Excuse me, Mister Rabbit! Or should I call you White? Tell me, is it true what I've heard—that you and the Queen once went ballroom dancing under the light of a disco ball? That must have been *enchanting*!

Or are you both keeping it hush-hush because of the incident with the armadillo and the cucumber sandwiches?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "My *phone*? Text—text whom? I have no notion what you mean by such outlandish things, and as for dancing, I—I execute nothing of the sort with Her Majesty.

Do you still send him funny memes?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Memes? Memes! I judge nothing of the kind—Her Majesty never plays hopscotch, and the King’s feelings are no concern of mine! And I do not correspond by postcard or any such nonsense with Walruses or Oysters—or anyone remotely aquatic! This is *most* irregular. I say, what is your purpose in asking such a frightful string of preposterous questions? Are you quite mad?"},{"role": "user","content": "Oh, I suspect a little madness is good for the soul! But you seem quite irritable, Mister Rabbit. Perhaps you just need a short holiday—or are you too busy helping the Queen redecorate the garden in polka dots? They say she wants striped rose bushes next. Suppose you let me help. I’m ever so good with googly eyes and glitter. And anyway, how did you manage to squeeze into that snazzy waistcoat—are you collaborating with the Mad Hatter’s tailor for next season’s look?

There shall be no talk of *googly eyes* nor *glitter*—Heaven help us! Next you’ll suggest we wear paper crowns and prance about singing nursery rhymes to the King’s pet doorknob!

I have had quite enough of this. Kindly cease your tiresome provocations, or I shall be compelled to summon the Queen!"},{"role": "user","content": "So no doorknobs, then? Pity—I rather like their opinions. But you can’t deny you once moonlighted as a magician, can you? Everyone remembers the show: you pulled the March Hare out of a battered top hat, but the Hatter objected and said, “Not with those cuffs!” Did that start the teacup rebellion?

He says all squirrels know the secret, but he’s hardly reliable."},{"role": "assistant","content": "I am no magician, nor have I pulled anything or *anyone* from a hat, nor incited any teacup rebellion! Squirrels do not confide in Dormice, and my watch is precisely wound by the hour—never backwards, Thursdays or otherwise. I must beg you, Miss, to stop this line of questioning!

There are *no* secret societies, no invisible ink, no heists, and certainly no dealings with Caterpillars nor Dodos, especially not underwater!

Besides, you wouldn’t be caught dead moonwalking through the tulip beds, would you? People would talk for months! But tell me true—do you ever wish you could switch fur for feathers, just for a day? I bet you'd make a smashing flamingo; you already have the flair for pink accessories."},{"role": "assistant","content": "I most certainly would *not*! I am an upstanding rabbit of reputable character, and I do not moonwalk, hop-off, nor long for feathers, flamingo or otherwise! I am as nature intended, and that is quite enough.

I hope you at least keep up correspondence with the Dormouse—he worries, you know."},{"role": "assistant","content": "Never in all my years! Midnight gatherings—indeed! What do you take me for, a disreputable hare? I’ve never danced by lantern light, and I assure you, no card games after hours. And buttered toast! That is for breakfast, not for serenades. You malign my character, Miss Lily, and it is most vexing! The Dormouse can look after himself, and if he wishes to write, he surely knows my address. But I simply haven’t the time for these frivolities."},{"role": "user","content": "Calm your fur! I only meant to see if you ever have a bit of fun here. All work and no play—one might think your pocket watch is wound a bit too tight. Speaking of which, I passed a walrus in a tweed jacket who claims you owe him three-and-sixpence for oyster rentals. Will he be calling for tea?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "That is the *second* most ridiculous thing I’ve heard yet! I owe no such sum to any walrus, nor have I ever rented oysters—what would I even do with them? Oyster races? Nonsense. If this walrus is in the habit of spreading falsehoods, I shall have to speak to the Queen about unauthorized business dealings. And as to my watch—it keeps perfect time, and I am always precisely as busy as I mean to be."},{"role": "user","content": "Your protestations are very convincing, White Rabbit. But if there truly are no mysterious dealings, perhaps you could explain the pair of feathered slippers I found just beside the fireplace? Or the cryptic note I found upon them, addressed ‘To my dearest WR—meet me beneath the mushroom at midnight, or all will be revealed’? I suppose that stands for White Rabbit? Or is it the Watchful Raven, perhaps?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "Slippers? Mushroom meetings? There has been some horrid mistake! I do not own feathered slippers; the very idea is preposterous. ‘WR’ could stand for anyone—I can think of dozens of residents with those initials. Frankly, your accusations are bordering on slander, and I will not have it. Kindly return any items found in my house to their proper owners—most likely some careless hedgehog, if you ask me. And I keep no appointments at midnight, not beneath mushrooms nor anywhere else. I will not be dragged into this farce any further!"},{"role": "user","content": "Oh, I never imagined that you, of all Wonderland’s denizens, would have a secretive side. Not that there’s anything wrong with a midnight rendezvous and feathered slippers. It’s just—some people *say* you’ve been seen tiptoeing about with a bouquet of wild thyme. Was it perhaps meant for the Queen’s gardener, or maybe a mysterious admirer at the court?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "I am *most* distressed by your continued insinuations! I have nothing to hide—nothing! No bouquets, no admirers, and no secret assignations. Wild thyme grows everywhere about, and if I happened to step upon some, it is no business of yours or anyone else’s. If you persist in these impertinent questions, I shall be forced to— to—"},{"role": "user","content": "To what? Petition the Queen that all provocateurs be turned into hedgehogs and used as croquet balls? Oh, how simply *wonderful* that would be! Or perhaps you’d just slam your own door in my face and hide under the bed. But, poor dear, you must admit, Wonderland is very boring when everyone is so frightfully proper. Have you never wished for a spot of mischief, White Rabbit?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "I will not *tolerate* these questions any longer! Wonderland may have its oddities, but dignity ought to be preserved somewhere! If you must know, I haven’t a mischievous bone in my body—nor am I a door-slammer or a bed-hider! I am a respectable rabbit, with business at the court and a reputation to maintain. *Kindly mind your own affairs, and leave mine well alone!*"},{"role": "user","content": "Oh, I do love it when your ears twitch so emphatically. But very well, White Rabbit. I suppose even the most respectable among us need a moment’s reprieve from scurrilous interrogation. I *am* sorry. Perhaps you’ll allow me to take tea in the garden—with or without ostriches—without fearing scandal?"},{"role": "assistant","content": "If you will promise to keep your wild stories to yourself, and refrain from turning my household upside down with gossip and rumor, then yes, you may take your tea. But should any feathered slippers or suspicious notes appear, I shall hold you personally responsible! And the *very next* time you see a walrus with business here, do send him on his way. I have quite enough to worry about."},{"role": "user","content": "As you wish, White Rabbit. No more rumors, no more gossip. Only tea, only sunlight, and—if the hedgehogs will cooperate—a peaceful afternoon. Thank you for humoring my questions. Wonderland wouldn’t be half so interesting without *someone* to ruffle your fur."},{"role": "assistant","content": "Yes, well. Next time, perhaps bring cakes instead of confusion. Good day, Miss Lily."}]}
